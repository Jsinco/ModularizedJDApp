 * This is just a class full of restrictions I know a canvas account using an API token can have.
 * I don't understand Canvas' API well enough to know if the issues with this are a wrapper problem,
 * or just that the school has ensured students can't use their API token for such activities.
 * <p>
 * For the time being, I'm going to assume it's the latter and that some tokens may not have access
 * to certain parts of an institution's API.
